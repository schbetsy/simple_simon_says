This is a one-page web app that adds a randomly-chosen color to a randomly-chosen space on the page.

This was a simple exercise from Week 6 of DevBootcamp to demonstrate my understanding of javascript, ajax, json, basic css, and controller actions in Sinatra. It uses javascript to bind an event to a button click, and uses AJAX to make a get request to the controller. The controller sends back a JSON response to indicate which cell to color, and what color to make it. It uses jQuery to make changes to the DOM.

To try it out: clone the repo, bundle, run shotgun, and look at localhost:3000.
